- [ ] Sync with the latest `main` branch before starting
- [ ] Review AGENTS.md and TASKS.md for any recent updates
- [ ] If requirements or best practices have changed, update AGENTS.md and/or TASKS.md before proceeding
- [ ] Set up your local environment and run all tests/builds to confirm a clean slate
- [ ] Plan your work in logical, testable task groups
- [ ] Document any assumptions or open questions at the top of your branch's PR or issue

## Notes
